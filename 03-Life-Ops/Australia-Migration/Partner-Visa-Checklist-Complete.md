## ⚠️ Critical Notes

1. **English Translations:** All non-English documents must have certified translations.
2. **Timing:** Police checks expire after 12 months; apply in March for June lodgment.
3. **Photos:** Quality over quantity. Aim for 20-30 strong photos showing genuine relationship progression.
4. **Form 888:** Choose referees who know both of you well and can write detailed, personal accounts.
5. **Health Checks:** Book panel doctor appointment as soon as Shawn arrives in Australia (if applying onshore).
