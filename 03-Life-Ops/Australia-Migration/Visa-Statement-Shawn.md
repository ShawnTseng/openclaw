# STATUTORY DECLARATION
**Statutory Declarations Act 1959**

I, **Tseng, Ji-Yang**, of **14F, No. 81, Sec. 1, Qingfeng Rd., Zhongli Dist., Taoyuan City**, Senior Software Engineer, make the following declaration under the *Statutory Declarations Act 1959*:

## 1. Development of the Relationship
Ting (The Applicant) and I first met on **15 July 2022** at the Soka Gakkai Taipei Jinzhou Center. We were both participating in a summer activity organized for junior and senior high school students. I was the person in charge of front-stage operations, and Ting was a support staff member. My first distinct memory of Ting was during a dance rehearsal where I was the choreographer. I noticed she learned the steps exceptionally quickly, so I asked her to assist in teaching others.

From July 2022, we attended several preparatory meetings. After the event concluded on **7 August 2022**, we began to interact more frequently, bonding over our shared life values and interest in dance. We officially entered into a committed and exclusive relationship on **1 September 2022**. On that day, at a McDonald's, I confessed my feelings, and we decided to be a couple.

We began living together on **1 July 2023** to establish a stable life and understand each other’s daily habits. We have resided at:
- **Taipei City (Zhongshan Dist.):** Aug 2023 – July 2025
- **Taoyuan City (Guanyin Dist.):** July 2025 – Jan 2026
- **Taoyuan City (Zhongli Dist.):** Jan 2026 – Present

Since the commencement of our relationship, we have never been separated. We plan all major life decisions with the premise of living together.

## 2. Financial Aspects of the Relationship
Ting and I have mutually agreed to keep our finances separate to maintain independence, so we do not hold a joint bank account. However, we have a consistent system for sharing expenses. Generally, we split rent, utilities, and meals 50/50. For convenience, one person pays upfront, and we reconcile expenses approximately once a month. We settle the balance using "**JKOPAY**" or bank transfer.

I personally purchased our current property in Zhongli District in **October 2025** and paid for the furniture. As I am seven years older and financially more established, this arrangement suits our current life stage. Ting, with her design background, contributed by handling the interior design and furniture selection. I have also provided financial support for Ting’s education in Australia by lending her the funds for her tuition fees.

## 3. Nature of the Household
We have developed a clear division of household labor. As I focus on dietary management, I prepare breakfast and wash dishes. Ting values cleanliness and is primarily responsible for cleaning and organizing the house. We typically take out the garbage together, treating it as a chance to take a walk and chat.

Evidence of our cohabitation is reflected in our **lease agreements from 2023 to 2025**, which list both our names (either as co-tenants or guarantor).

## 4. Social Aspects of the Relationship
Our relationship is known to and accepted by both our families. I have visited Ting's parents multiple times (2024, 2025). On one occasion, I stayed overnight at their family home, and on another visit, I stayed at a nearby hotel. Furthermore, I have planned to visit her parents again during the Lunar New Year in **February 2026**. Similarly, Ting has visited my family in Taichung and stayed at my parents' apartment. My parents have welcomed her and shared meals with us.

We share a mutual circle of friends, primarily from the Soka Gakkai organization. We also travel with friends; for instance, we are planning a ski trip to Japan in **March 2026** with two of my university friends who have become close with Ting. We have traveled extensively together, including trips to Singapore, Okinawa (Japan), Xiaoliuqiu, and Kinmen. We have concrete plans for our immediate future, including an upcoming trip to Tokyo and attending a language school in the Philippines (**April–May 2026**) to prepare for our time in Australia.

## 5. Nature of the Commitment
Over the past three years, we have demonstrated our commitment to shared goals. A significant example was our decision to move from Taipei to a suburb in Guanyin District. We made this strategic move to afford a larger space with the same budget, allowing us to have separate rooms to practice English speaking for our IELTS exams. This mutual sacrifice and dedication paid off when we both achieved an **IELTS score of 6.5 in December 2025**.

We have supported each other through significant health challenges. On one occasion, I suffered from severe gastroenteritis; Ting called the ambulance and stayed by my side in the emergency room throughout the night. Furthermore, when I was diagnosed with **Stage 2 Chronic Kidney Disease**, I felt emotionally low. Ting provided immense mental and emotional support during that period.

Conversely, as I am older, I provide Ting with guidance and consultation regarding her career path and financial planning. We share similar core values regarding our faith and political views. Having lived together for three years, we understand each other’s habits deeply and have successfully navigated the "adjustment period" of our relationship.

Regarding our future, we have discussed marriage and children but have not reached a definitive conclusion yet. We believe in waiting until Ting has further developed her career. We have not yet made wills, which reflects our current life stage and cultural norms. Our plan for Australia is focused on Ting’s education and gaining international experience. If Ting decides to work in Australia for two years post-graduation to gain experience, I will support her. Alternatively, if we decide to return to Taiwan, we have a stable base. I have purchased a home in Taoyuan which is convenient for commuting to the airport and Taipei. We are flexible and committed to making decisions that align with our shared future, whether that involves staying in our current home or moving to suit our career needs in Taiwan.

I understand that a person who intentionally makes a false statement in a statutory declaration is guilty of an offence under section 11 of the *Statutory Declarations Act 1959*, and I believe that the statements in this declaration are true in every particular.
