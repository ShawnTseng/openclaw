> **Created:** 2026-02-14  
> **Strategy:** Shift from "Selling Tools" to "Selling Results"  
> **Goal:** Maximize margins & reduce support overhead.

## 🎯 Core Strategy Shift

### ❌ Old Paradigm: Selling Tools
- OpenClaw SaaS (91% margin, but high support burden).
- BuddyShopAI Setup (One-off revenue, hard to scale).

### ✅ New Paradigm: Selling Results
- **Value Prop:** "I help you make money/save time," not "I install AI for you."
- **Customer Focus:** Clients don't care about tech; they care about ROI.
- **Pricing Power:** Value-based pricing > Cost-plus pricing.
