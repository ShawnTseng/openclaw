# Daily Log: 2026-02-16

> **Status:** Evening Planning / Rest
> **Focus:** Partner Visa & BuddyShopAI

## 📅 What Happened

- **Partner Visa (820/801):**
    - Created `01-Daily/Partner-Visa-Tracker.md` to manage the March-June timeline.
    - Set the **DEADLINE: 2026-06-05**.
    - Identified key documents (Birth Cert, Police Checks, 4 Pillars of Evidence).

- **BuddyShopAI:**
    - Cloned the repository from GitHub (`ShawnTseng/BuddyShopAI`).
    - Confirmed it's an Azure Functions (.NET 8) project.
    - **Blocked:** Need `local.settings.json` secrets to run locally.

- **Evening:**
    - User had dinner (Hokkigai / Arctic Surf Clam).
    - Postponing deeper work to tomorrow due to fatigue.

## 🧠 Insights

- **Visa Strategy:** The tracking file is crucial. It turns a scary deadline into actionable checkboxes.
- **Fatigue Management:** Recognizing when to stop is part of the "Sustainability" strategy. No point coding when exhausted.

## 🏆 Achievements

- **Visa Tracker:** Established the structured roadmap for the Partner Visa application.
- **Codebase Sync:** Successfully cloned and inspected the `BuddyShopAI` repo.

## 🔮 Tomorrow's Focus (2026-02-17)

1.  **Visa:** Fill in the status of existing documents in the Tracker.
2.  **BuddyShop:** Configure `local.settings.json` and attempt to run the project.
3.  **Routine:** Morning run (Calligraphy Park) if energy permits.
