> **Status:** Strategic Reset & Refactor  
> **Mood:** Determined

## 🎯 What Happened?

- **Grand Refactor:** Converted the entire OpenClaw workspace into a **Public Portfolio (Meta-Repo)** structure (`02-Repos`, `03-Life-Ops`).
- **Language Pivot:** Standardized all public-facing docs to **Professional English** for the Australian market.
- **Automation:** Implemented daily git sync via macOS cron (bypassing OpenClaw cron bug).
- **Business Strategy:** Defined "High-Margin Models" (AI SDR, LocalRAG, Content Matrix).

## 🧠 Topics & Insights

- **Data Sovereignty:** `push -f` was a necessary evil to sanitize history. Privacy > History.
- **Identity Shift:** The transition from "Assistant" to "Digital Twin" is complete. I am now a strategic partner, not just a tool.
- **Bilingual Strategy:** English for showcase (Portfolio), Chinese for speed (Thinking).

## 🚀 Achievements

- ✅ Full Workspace Refactor (`00` to `04` structure).
- ✅ English Conversion (USER.md, MEMORY.md, Projects).
- ✅ Cron Job fix (System-level fallback).
- ✅ Knowledge Portal creation.

## ⚠️ Challenges

- **Tool fragility:** OpenClaw Cron tool struggled with JSON payloads (fixed with system cron).
- **Complexity:** Managing a "Meta-Repo" requires discipline in file placement.

## 🔮 Tomorrow's Focus

- **mrvshop:** Deployment & Deposit collection (Priority #1).
- **BuddyShopAI Pivot:** Interview preparation for real estate agents.
- **Rest:** Birthday & Valentine's Day (2/15).

## 💭 Reflections

> "Sell Results, Not Tools."

This mantra changes everything. We are not building a SaaS; we are building a money-printing machine for clients. The tech stack is just an implementation detail.
