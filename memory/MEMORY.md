## [P1] Active Projects & Strategic Initiatives (< 90 days)

### 1. Career Repositioning (4AM Breakthrough - 2026-02-17)

**Strategic Pivot**:
- **From:** "Senior .NET Architect with Modern React Expertise"
- **To:** "Senior Cloud Platform Engineer & .NET Architect (DevOps Focus)"

**Market Analysis**:
- AI is commoditizing pure coding work (especially junior-level)
- Australia market demands: **DevOps/Platform Engineering** > Pure Software Engineering
- Value proposition: "The Developer who can build and operate the Platform"

**Positioning Strategy**:
- **Title:** Senior Cloud Platform Engineer & .NET Architect
- **Tagline:** "Bridging Development and Operations with Cloud-Native .NET and AI"
- **Key Skills Emphasis:**
  - Infrastructure as Code (Azure Bicep, Terraform)
  - CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)
  - Kubernetes/Container Apps
  - SRE/Observability
  - System Reliability & Performance Engineering

**Deliverables** (Created 2026-02-17):
- ✅ Resume rewritten: `02-Repos/Content-Matrix/Drafts/ShawnTseng-Resume-2026-Architect.md`
- ✅ External presence plan: `02-Repos/Content-Matrix/Drafts/External-Presence-Revamp.md`
- ✅ Content strategy updated: `02-Repos/Content-Matrix/Strategy.md`
- ✅ 4AM insights documented: `01-Daily/2026-02-17-4AM-Breakthrough.md`

**Next Actions** (When back in Taoyuan):
- [ ] Update GitHub Profile README
- [ ] Update personal website (shawn-tseng.vercel.app)
- [ ] Update LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Consider AZ-305 certification (see Certification Strategy below)

### 2. Certification Strategy (AZ-305 vs AZ-400)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ **AZ-104** (Azure Administrator Associate) - Already certified

**Decision Matrix**:
| Aspect | AZ-305 (Solutions Architect) | AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer) |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Positioning** | "The Architect who plans" | "The Engineer who builds" |
| **Preparation Time** | 2-3 weeks (30-40% overlap with AZ-104) | 4-6 weeks (deeper technical depth) |
| **Market Demand** | Traditional enterprises, consulting | Tech companies, banks in transformation |
| **Your Advantage** | Validates existing architecture experience | Proves new DevOps transformation |

**Recommended Path** (2026-02-17):
1. **Short-term:** Target **AZ-305** first
   - Leverage fresh AZ-104 knowledge
   - Quick win for "Solutions Architect Expert" title
   - Strong for LinkedIn/resume impact
   
2. **Long-term:** Demonstrate AZ-400 skills through **BuddyShopAI project**
   - GitOps workflow
   - Azure Container Apps deployment
   - Bicep IaC
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD
   - "Show, don't tell" approach

**Decision Point:** Post-Japan trip (late Feb 2026)

### 3. BuddyShopAI (DevOps Showcase)
- **Status:** **P0 Priority** (Cloned; Config pending).
- **Tech:** .NET 8 API + Next.js 14 App Router + Azure Container Apps.
- **Positioning:** Not just a SaaS product, but a **"DevOps/Platform Engineering Portfolio Piece"**.
- **Key Features to Highlight:**
  - Infrastructure as Code (Bicep templates)
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
  - Container orchestration (Azure Container Apps)
  - AI Ops integration (Semantic Kernel for log analysis)
  - GitOps workflow
- **Strategy:** AI SDR for Real Estate/Insurance (high-margin, commission model).
- **Action:** Configure `local.settings.json` & Launch.

### 4. LocalRAG (Enterprise Data Privacy)
- **Status:** Ready for Pilot.
- **Tech:** Ollama, pgvector, Docker.
- **Target:** Law/Accounting firms (Data sovereignty as selling point).
- **Positioning:** Part of "Trustless AI Workflows" content strategy.

### 5. OpenClaw System Optimization (Sammy Lin's Protocol)
- **Status:** Implemented 2026-02-17.
- **Changes:**
  - ✅ Memory Hierarchy: P0 (Core) / P1 (Active <90d) / P2 (Context <30d)
  - ✅ Protocol: Markdown First, Sub-Agent Offloading, Issue-First approach
  - ✅ Weekly Self-Reflection: Cron job (Sunday 22:00) added
  - ✅ All cron jobs now report to correct Discord channel (#system-log)
- **Philosophy:** "Don't build an assistant; design a self-operating system."

### 6. OpenClaw Portfolio (Meta-Repo)
- **Status:** Live & Auto-syncing.
- **Strategy:** `~/.openclaw/workspace` as living technical resume.
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ShawnTseng/openclaw
- **Auto-Sync:** Daily Git push via cron (23:55 Taipei time).

## [P2] Context & Temporary (Active < 30 days)

### Content Strategy Themes (Updated 2026-02-17)

**Primary Focus:**
1. **Cloud Platform Engineering & DevOps** (Azure, Bicep, Kubernetes)
   - Target: Enterprise .NET shops migrating to cloud
   - Goal: Demonstrate architectural + operational expertise

2. **Trustless AI Workflows** (Enterprise Data Privacy, LocalRAG)
   - Target: Risk-averse industries (law, accounting, healthcare)
   - Goal: Differentiate from generic AI wrappers

3. **Australia Migration Journey** (Tech visa, bridging Dev & Ops)
   - Target: Fellow engineers considering AU migration
   - Goal: Build community & authority

**Platform Strategy:**
- **LinkedIn:** Primary channel for professional networking (AU job market)
- **Personal Blog (Next.js):** Deep technical dives and tutorials
- **Medium:** Syndication for broader reach

**Deprioritized:**
- Generic Teams AI integrations (low differentiation)
- Pure AI wrapper tutorials (commoditized)

### Travel Schedule
- **Japan Trip:** Late Feb 2026
- **Back in Taoyuan:** TBD (will decide on certification path then)

## [Archive] Patterns & Lessons

### Career Strategy
- **Market Shift (2026):** AI commoditizes coding → Value moves to infrastructure/operations
- **Australia Demand:** DevOps/SRE/Platform Engineering > Pure Development
- **Differentiation:** "Developer who can build the Platform" vs "Developer who codes features"

### Execution Principles
- **Sell Results:** Clients buy ROI, not AI features.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Local RAG = key enterprise selling point.
- **Automation:** System-level (cron) > Application-level.
- **Security:** `git push -f` to sanitize history when needed.
- **Sustainability:** Rest is strategic (4AM insights prove this).

### Technical Decisions
- **.NET as Moat:** Enterprise stability + modern cloud capabilities
- **React/Next.js for Frontend:** Proves modernization capability
- **Azure First:** Aligns with AU enterprise market (not AWS-first like US)
- **IaC Non-Negotiable:** Bicep/Terraform mandatory for Platform Engineering credibility

### System Architecture
- **OpenClaw as OS:** Not an assistant, but a self-operating system
- **Markdown is Truth:** All decisions/specs must be in Markdown (chat is ephemeral)
- **Sub-Agent Pattern:** Parallelize complex work to isolated sessions
- **Issue-First:** Never code without a written spec/issue
