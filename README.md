# OpenClaw Configuration

My personal AI assistant configuration, powered by [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the configuration and knowledge base for my digital twin. It is structured to separate public knowledge from private data.

- **`02-Projects/`**: Project documentation and tech specs.
- **`04-Travel/`**: Travel plans and logs.
- **`scripts/`**: Automation scripts for maintenance and syncing.
- **`openclaw.json`**: Core configuration (sanitized).

## 🤖 Models

- **Primary:** Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro High) for reasoning.
- **Fallback:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.5) for coding.

## 🔄 Automation

- Daily git sync via cron job.
- Weekly memory refinement via automated prompts.
