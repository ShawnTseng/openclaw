# OpenClaw Configuration

My personal AI assistant configuration, powered by [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai).

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the configuration and knowledge base for my digital twin. It is structured to separate public knowledge from private data, serving as both a technical portfolio and a working environment.

- **`02-Projects/`**: Project documentation and tech specs (English/Chinese).
- **`04-Travel/`**: Travel plans and logs.
- **`scripts/`**: Automation scripts for maintenance and syncing.
- **`openclaw.json`**: Core configuration (sanitized).

## 🤖 Models Architecture

- **Reasoning:** Google Antigravity (Gemini 3 Pro High/Ultra)
- **Coding:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus)
- **Strategy:** Local Memory Context + Cloud Compute

## 🔄 Automation Workflow

1.  **Daily Sync:** Auto-commit and push to GitHub (23:55).
